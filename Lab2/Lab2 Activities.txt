Activities:
Lab 2A: Translations and Scale Transformations, Aspect Ratio, GL_MODELVIEW, GL_PROJECTION, glutTimerFunc, animation
1. Draw a centered Circle
2. Maintain the same coordinate system when the screen is resized//Avoid object distortion when you resize the screen
3. Move (Translate) the circle through x-axe 
4. Animate the ball (circle) using scale and translation coordinates
5.* Extra Activity: Move the ball around window edges

Lab 2B: Apply different transformations on specific objects, glPushMatrix(), glPopMatrix(), glMultMatrixf(matrix)
1. Draw 3 squares
2. Apply one (same transformation) transformation to 2 squares
3. Apply shear to 3rd square
