For whom was absent in the last laboratory, in this file you can find the main activities that were performed on last Friday.
The lab was based on draw an Icosahedron (3D object with 12 faces)
The performed activities were the following:
a.) Complete the code (write the code in TODO: sections, use prac5A.cpp) to render the object.

In order to build a Circumference based on Icosahedron  (avoid sharp points)
b.) Based in the same object, divide each triangle in 4 triangles
c.) Divide each triangle in many triangles (many as you want), use recursivity.
